## About me

I am Javier Saiz and my background is on Linguistics (BA in Modern Languages and Translation, UAH, 2021) and Computer Science (MA in Natural Language Analysis and Processing, UPV-EHU, 2023). 

Here I publish and share with you my personal projects, where I develop my interest and experience on Data Science and, more specifically, on Information Extraction in the Clinical domain.
