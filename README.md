# About me

My background is on Linguistics (BA in Modern Languages and Translation, UAH, 2021) and Computer Science (MA in Natural Language Analysis and Processing, UPV/ EHU, 2023). 

Here I publish and share my personal projects, where I develop my interest and experience on Machine Learning and, more specifically, on Information Extraction in the clinical domain.
